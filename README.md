1. In the Github Repository I selected the settings tab and scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section.
2. In the source section, for the branch drop down menu, I selected "Main" and then clicked the save button.
3. Once this process had been completed the website URL was displayed above the GitHub Pages section.

This code can be cloned or forked from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nlenno1/funnier_bones).
